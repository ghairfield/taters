C Containers
---

This project was started 31 Oct 2019 as something I could casually work on. 
At the moment I currently am in the middle of a quarter, but wanted a project 
I could spend small increments of time working on. So here we are...

### String 

Starting with the String library, I am looking to make a general string class,
similar to c++'s string class. Once it is complete, I look forward to optimizing
the code and see what results I can achieve from it. 

Currently:
- [x] Create a string
- [x] Destroy the memory
- [ ] Re-size a string to fit
- [ ] Search forward and reverse
- [ ] Sub-string
- [ ] In situ tokenizing
- [ ] Regular expressions?
- [ ] Write tests
